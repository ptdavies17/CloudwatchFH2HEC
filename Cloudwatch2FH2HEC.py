For processing data sent to Firehose by Cloudwatch Logs subscription filters.

Cloudwatch Logs sends to Firehose records that look like this:

{
  "messageType": "DATA_MESSAGE",
  "owner": "123456789012",
  "logGroup": "log_group_name",
  "logStream": "log_stream_name",
  "subscriptionFilters": [
    "subscription_filter_name"
  ],
  "logEvents": [
    {
      "id": "01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345",
      "timestamp": 1510109208016,
      "message": "log message 1"
    },
    {
      "id": "01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345",
      "timestamp": 1510109208017,
      "message": "log message 2"
    }
    ...
  ]
}

The data is additionally compressed with GZIP.

NOTE: It is suggested to test the cloudwatch logs processor lambda function in a pre-production environment to ensure
the 6000000 limit meets your requirements. If your data contains a sizable number of records that are classified as
Dropped/ProcessingFailed, then it is suggested to lower the 6000000 limit within the function to a smaller value
(eg: 5000000) in order to confine to the 6MB (6291456 bytes) payload limit imposed by lambda. You can find Lambda
quotas at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html

The code below will:

1) Gunzip the data
2) Parse the json
3) Set the result to ProcessingFailed for any record whose messageType is not DATA_MESSAGE, thus redirecting them to the
   processing error output. Such records do not contain any log events. You can modify the code to set the result to
   Dropped instead to get rid of these records completely.
4) For records whose messageType is DATA_MESSAGE, extract the individual log events from the logEvents field, and pass
   each one to the transformLogEvent method. You can modify the transformLogEvent method to perform custom
   transformations on the log events.
5) Concatenate the result from (4) together and set the result as the data of the record returned to Firehose. Note that
   this step will not add any delimiters. Delimiters should be appended by the logic within the transformLogEvent
   method.
6) Any individual record exceeding 6,000,000 bytes in size after decompression and encoding is marked as
   ProcessingFailed within the function. The original compressed record will be backed up to the S3 bucket
   configured on the Firehose.
7) Any additional records which exceed 6MB will be re-ingested back into Firehose.
8) The retry count for intermittent failures during re-ingestion is set 20 attempts. If you wish to retry fewer number
   of times for intermittent failures you can lower this value.
